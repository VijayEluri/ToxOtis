h1. Publish your Component

h2. 1. POSTing a Component

p<>. A client can publish some OpenTox component, that is obtain a URI for its resource on some publicly available location, using the "POST":http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.5 HTTP method. According to the OpenTox "REST API":http://opentox.org/dev/framework/restweb clients create new resources and acquire a URI for them by POSTing an RDF representation of these resources to an appropriate service. There are a couple of notes we need to make here. First, the entity is always "POSTed":http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.5 as an "RDF":http://www.w3.org/RDF/ document containing all necessary information that describe the OpenTox component in a formal way according to the specifications of the "OpenTox ontology":http://opentox.org/data/documents/development/RDF%20files/OpenToxOntology/view . Second, as far as the service response is concerned, the following status codes are possible:

* "200":http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.2.1 A new resource is created; the URI(s) of the created resource(s) is(are) contained in the response body.
* "202":http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.2.3 An asynchronous job was initiated and a Task is returned to the client to monitor the progress of the procedure.
* "400":http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.4.1 The representation that was POSTed by the client is malformed (syntactic or semantic errors) or some other parameters in the request are inappropriate.
* "404":http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.4.5 The location at which the client attempted to POST the entity was not found on the server.
* "500":http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.5.1 Internal Server Error
* "503":http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.5.4 The service is temporarily unavailable: The resource is created but not yet available

Publishable components in ToxOtis subclass "OTPublishable":http://github.com/alphaville/ToxOtis/blob/master/src/org/opentox/toxotis/core/OTPublishable.java which defines two abstract methods: <code>Task publishOnline(VRI,AuthenticationToken)</code> and <code>Task publishOnline(AuthenticationToken)</code>. We copy here the documentation for the first of these two that allows users to POST their components to a specified server:

<pre>
/**
* Publish the component to a proper server identified by the uri of the
* publishing service provided in this method. The resource will be posted to the
* server in RDF format (Mediatype: application/rdf+xml).
* @param token
*      Provide an authentication token. If you think that the service does not
*      require auhtentication/authorization, you can leave this field <code>null</code> or
*      you can provide an empty authentication token.If the provided URI
*      already contains an authentication token (as the URL parameter <code>
*      tokenid</code>) it will be replaced by the new token provided to
*      this method.
* @return
*      A Task for monitoring the progress of your request. If the service
*      returns the URI of the resource right away and does not return a task,
*      then the object you will receive from this method will now have an identifier,
*      its status will be set to {@link Task.Status#COMPLETED }, its progress
*      will be set to <code>100%</code> and the URI of the created resource will
*      be available applying the method {@link Task#getResultUri() } on the returned
*      task. In any case, the service's response will be wrapped in a {@link Task }
*      object.
* @throws ToxOtisException
*      In case of invalid credentials, if the POSTed resource is not acceptable
*      by the remote service (returns a status code 400), communication error
*      occur with the remote server or other connection problems or the access
*      to the service was denied (401 or 403).

public abstract Task publishOnline(VRI vri, AuthenticationToken token) throws ToxOtisException;

h2. 2. Examples

h3. 2.1. Publish a Feature

Using the ToxOtis API, one can create a new feature and publish it to some feature server. Here is an example:

<pre>
Feature f = new Feature();
f.setUnits("m^4*mA*s^2*kg^-2");
f.getMeta().setTitle("Toxicity of my city");
f.getMeta().setHasSource("http://otherserver.net:8283/opentox/model/15451");
f.getMeta().setSameAs("http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKmQmkJ9gg");
Task t = f.publishOnline(Services.AMBIT_UNI_PLOVDIV.augment("feature"), null);
System.out.println(t.getResultUri());
</pre>

This will print a "feature URI":http://ambit.uni-plovdiv.bg:8080/ambit2/feature/22210 to the standard output of your System.


h3. 2.2. Publish a bibliographic reference

We can publish a bibliographic reference as we did with features. Here is an example where a BibTeX object is created and published online:

<pre>
BibTeX bib = new BibTeX(); // ...Create anonymous bibtex
bib.setAuthor("Chung W.");
bib.setTitle("The truth about UFOs");
bib.setVolume(100);
bib.setJournal("International Journal of Conspiracy Theory");
bib.setCrossref("http://localhost:3000/bibtex/549a9f40-9758-44b3-90fe-db31fe1a1a01");
bib.setBibType(BibTeX.BIB_TYPE.Article);
Task t = bib.publishOnline(Services.NTUA.augment("bibtex")), null);
</pre>


h3. 2.3. Publish a dataset

POSTing a dataset always creates a new resource. A task URI is usually returned to the the client (with HTTP status 202) for monitoring the progress of the uploading. In the following example a dataset is downloaded from a remote server and POSTed to some other dataset server. Particularly, only the first 5 compounds of the dataset are requested using the URL query <code>?max=N</code>.

<pre>
VRI vri = new VRI(Services.IDEACONSULT.augment("dataset", "54").addUrlParameter("max", "5"));
Dataset ds = new Dataset(vri).loadFromRemote();
Task t = ds.publishOnline(Services.AMBIT_UNI_PLOVDIV.augment("dataset"), null);
System.out.println(t.getHasStatus());
while (t.getHasStatus().equals(Task.Status.RUNNING)) {
     t.loadFromRemote();
     Thread.sleep(100);
}
System.out.println(t.getResultUri());
</pre>

The above example will POST the dataset as application/rdf+xml to the dataset server at "ambit.uni-plovdiv.bg":http://ambit.uni-plovdiv.bg:8080/ambit2/dataset and monitor the returned task. The dataset "http://ambit.uni-plovdiv.bg:8080/ambit2/dataset/64":http://ambit.uni-plovdiv.bg:8080/ambit2/dataset/64 has been created by running the above example code.
