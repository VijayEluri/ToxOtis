h1. ToxOtis and Weka

h2. Converting a Dataset into a weka.core.Instances object

p<>. ToxOtis can be used in combintation with "Weka":http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/ (version 3.6.2), a well known open source machine learning package for Java. Using ToxOtis you can convert your <a href="http://github.com/alphaville/ToxOtis/blob/master/src/org/opentox/toxotis/core/Dataset.java">datasets</a> into instances of "weka.core.Instances":http://nlp.stanford.edu/nlp/javadoc/weka-3-2/weka.core.Instances.html which in turn can be used in some filtering, training or other data processing procedure. Here is an example of downloading a dataset and creating a corresponding "weka.core.Instances":http://nlp.stanford.edu/nlp/javadoc/weka-3-2/weka.core.Instances.html object. 

<pre>
VRI vri = new VRI(Services.IDEACONSULT.augment("dataset","9"));
Dataset ds = new Dataset(vri);
ds.loadFromRemote();
weka.core.Instances data = ds.getInstances();
</pre>

Unfortunately, "Instances":http://nlp.stanford.edu/nlp/javadoc/weka-3-2/weka.core.Instances.html objects are just data wrappers and were not designed to serve as data models so all meta information about the dataset and its contained features and compounds will not be found in this object.
