<b>Version:</b>
 + "0.8.4":http://opentox.ntua.gr:8081/nexus/index.html#view-repositories;releases~browsestorage (Available from the  "NTUA":http://ambit.uni-plovdiv.bg:8083/nexus/index.html#view-repositories;thirdparty~browsestorage Maven repository).

<b>Description:</b>
 + ToxOtis is the Greek word for Sagittarius, that actually means 'archer'. ToxOtis is a Java interface to the predictive toxicology services of "OpenTox":http://opentox.org. ToxOtis is being developed to help both those who need a painless way to consume "OpenTox":http://opentox.org services and for ambitious service providers that don't want to spend half of their time in RDF parsing and creation.
 + You can use ToxOtis to search in databases with chemical compounds, download a compound in any supported MIME type (e.g. SDF, SMILES, MOL etc), find a property for a compound (e.g. its LD50 lethal dose concentration), publish your chemicals in an online database, train QSAR models (regression, classification, clustering etc) and lots of other functionalities. Incorporation of ToxOtis into your services will relieve you from the labour of creating RDF documents. 
 + You can find full documentation at the "doc":http://github.com/alphaville/ToxOtis/tree/master/doc/ directory including lots of examples. For any questions don't hesitate contact to the authors by sending a message to "alphaville":http://github.com/alphaville or "hampos":http://github.com/hampos (on "github":http://github.com ).

<b>Quality Control:</b>
+ For every piece of code introduced in ToxOtis we write extensive unit tests. Recently (since version 0.8.2) we started using the Cobertura Maven plugin calculate our overall code coverage in ToxOtis-core (which was found to be 41% - fair enough!). You can access the report online "here":http://opentox.ntua.gr/cobertura .

<b>Documentation:</b>
You will find numerous examples and hints on our "wiki page":http://opentox.ntua.gr/wiki. Additionally, the source code is accompanied by javadoc that is available on our "Nexus repository":http://opentox.ntua.gr:8081/nexus/index.html#view-repositories;releases~browsestorage.

h2. Use ToxOtis

h3. With Maven 

   Recently ToxOtis migrated to "Maven":http://maven.apache.org/ so it becomes really easy for you to use ToxOtis in your Maven projects. ToxOtis, since version 0.5.2 (beta)  is deployed on the "AMBIT":http://ambit.uni-plovdiv.bg:8083/nexus/index.html#view-repositories;thirdparty~browsestorage repository as a 3rd-party 'artifact'. So, if you want to include the "core" module of ToxOtis in your project, simply put the following dependency in the pom file of your project:

<pre>
<dependencies>
  <!-- ToxOtis Dependency -->
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.opentox.toxotis</groupId>
    <artifactId>ToxOtis-core</artifactId>
    <version>0.5.2</version>
  </dependency>
  <!-- Other Dependencies you might have... -->
</dependencies>
</pre>

and add once the following repository:

<pre>
<repositories>
  <!-- NTUA Repository -->
  <repository>
    <id>ntua-public</id>
    <url>http://opentox.ntua.gr:8081/nexus/content/repositories/public/</url>
    <snapshots>
      <enabled>false</enabled>
    </snapshots>
  </repository>
</repositories>
</pre>


h3. With Ant

  If you prefer the ant-based ToxOtis the build.xml files are also distributed along with the source code. Alternatively run <code>mvn ant:ant</code> and create your own XML files for ant. Alternatively, you can download the latest version from our "Nexus repository":http://opentox.ntua.gr:8081/nexus/index.html#view-repositories;releases~browsestorage and add it to your classpath.


h2. Source Code and Javadoc

  You can manually download the latest version of the source code of ToxOtis from github either in zip or tar.gz format (click on the "Downloads" button). This is most likely to be a SNAPSHOT version. If you want the source code and/or the javadoc for a particular release version, here is an example source code (just choose the version you prefer):

<pre>
<!-- Dependency for Javadoc -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.opentox.toxotis</groupId>
  <artifactId>ToxOtis-core</artifactId>
  <version>0.5.2</version>
  <classifier>javadoc</classifier>
</dependency>
<!-- Dependency for Sources -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.opentox.toxotis</groupId>
  <artifactId>ToxOtis-core</artifactId>
  <version>0.5.2</version>
  <classifier>sources</classifier>
</dependency>
</pre>

h3. Freely distributed

This project is licensed under the GNU GPL license version 3.0. A copy of this license is found in the ./Licenses folder. Licenses for all dependencies of this project are also included in this directory.

This project is being developed in the "Automatic Control Lab":http://www.chemeng.ntua.gr/labs/control_lab/index.html of the "School of Chemical Engineering":http://www.chemeng.ntua.gr/index.php?lang_change=en, "NTUA":http://www.ntua.gr/index_en.html, Athens, Greece and is part of "OpenTox":http://opentox.org; an EU funded FP7 research project.

h3. Extensible

We work on various extensions for ToxOtis including modules that will facilitate external developers towards builing their own web service applications or applications that need to consume OpenTox web services as client. Modules that provide extra security mechanisms and local account management, Hibernate support for ToxOtis to provide persistence for all core ToxOtis objects (Datasets, Algorithms, Models etc), Triple-storage database support (TDB) and lots of other features are under design and construction. The first release of "ToxOtis-Persistence":http://github.com/hampos/ToxOtis-persistence, a persistence module for ToxOtis, provides hibernate support for the core project. 


h2. License

 This project, as well as all other projects developed by the NTUA developers team under OpeTox, is licensed under the "GNU GPL license version 3":http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html. There is a considerable debate taking place in the open source community regarding the use of the GPL or LGPL, while a variety of other licenses can be found on the web as well. However it is GNU itself that prompts developers to use GPL (read "this article":http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html). The license of this project (ToxOtis) is also inherited by its modules (ToxOtis-core, ToxOtis-persistence and ToxOtis-benchmark).
 Information about the licenses of the project are also provided in its "pom.xml file":https://github.com/alphaville/ToxOtis/blob/master/pom.xml including information about the involved developers and organizations.
