<b>Description:</b>
 + ToxOtis is the Greek word for Sagittarius, that actually means 'archer'. ToxOtis is a Java interface to the predictive toxicology services of "OpenTox":http://opentox.org. ToxOtis is being developed to help both those who need a painless way to consume "OpenTox":http://opentox.org services and for ambitious service providers that don't want to spend half of their time in RDF parsing and creation.

 + You can use ToxOtis to search in databases with chemical compounds, download a compound in any supported MIME type (e.g. SDF, SMILES, MOL etc), find a property for a compound (e.g. its LD ~50~ lethal dose concentration), publish your chemicals in an online database, train QSAR models (regression, classification, clustering etc) and lots of other functionalities. Incorporation of ToxOtis into your services will relieve you from the labour of creating RDF documents. 

 + You can find full documentation at the "doc":http://github.com/alphaville/ToxOtis/tree/master/doc/ directory including lots of examples. For any questions don't hesitate contact to the authors by sending a message to "alphaville":http://github.com/alphaville or "hampos":http://github.com/hampos (in "github":http://github.com ).

This project is being developed in the "Automatic Control Lab":http://www.chemeng.ntua.gr/labs/control_lab/index.html of the "School of Chemical Engineering":http://www.chemeng.ntua.gr/index.php?lang_change=en, "NTUA":http://www.ntua.gr/index_en.html, Athens, Greece and is part of "OpenTox":http://opentox.org; an EU funded FP7 research project.

h3. Extensible

We work on various extensions for ToxOtis including modules that will facilitate external developers towards builing their own web service applications or applications that need to consume OpenTox web services as client. Modules that provide extra security mechanisms and local account management, Hibernate support for ToxOtis to provide persistence for all core ToxOtis objects (Datasets, Algorithms, Models etc), Triple-storage database support (TDB) and lots of other features are under design and construction. The first release of "ToxOtis-Persistence":http://github.com/hampos/ToxOtis-persistence, a persistence module for ToxOtis, provides hibernate support for the core project.
