 * ToxOtis is the Greek word for Sagittarius, that actually means ‘archer’. ToxOtis
 * is a Java interface to the predictive toxicology services of OpenTox. ToxOtis is
 * being developed to help both those who need a painless way to consume OpenTox
 * services and for ambitious service providers that don’t want to spend half of
 * their time in RDF parsing and creation.
